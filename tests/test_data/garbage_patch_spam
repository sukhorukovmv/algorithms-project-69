Garbage Patch

Save the WORLD!

Garbage everywhere. Everyone is talking about garbage. Ghostbusters are now chasing garbage people come to their senses!
The era of consumption will kill us. We are obsessed with the outer paraphernalia of prosperity. Murder, hunger, crime don't bother me. And what worries me is celebrities and scandals, a TV with 500 channels, whose name is on the tag of cowards.
The world is about to go to the bottom, so it's time to spit on all those sofas, green upholstery.
I believe to hell with perfection, to hell with prosperity. Don't give a damn about it all. It's time to evolve.
People are slaves to their things. Your job is not yourself. So is your money in the bank. And your car. Your wallet. And your clothes. You're just a bunch of life's waste. We're just a bunch of singing and dancing feces. Eat the trash before it kills you!

CATS::
Cats and kittens can be so cute! You can use these Japanese cat emoticons for almost any occasion, like texting to friends or a significant other. Don’t you love being able to express yourself in so many different ways? Using these text emojis can really add a second dimension to what you’re trying to convey online.
Cat smileys are probably some of the oldest emoticons in internet history. The original cat kaomoji looked like this =^_^= and =(^_^)= with = being the whiskers ^ the happy eyes (some people may read this as ears!) and _ the mouth. Now with an ever increasing assortment of unicode characters available, cat emoticons can take on all sorts of exciting and unique expressions!
You can’t go wrong with these! By the way, ᨐ can be read as cat ears with two eyes.
